#TCP2201 - Ants & Bugs Simulation Program

This is an assignment project for TCP2201 Object-Oriented Analysis & Design subject which was
done in around 2020 by a group of four students. The aim is to apply all concepts learnt 
throughout this subject. Even though it was done successfully without any error and passed the
interview with the subject lecturer, a lot of improvements could be done after walking through 
this project once again at this day (29/3/2022).

Hence, this project will be updated from time-to-time with the purpose to improve the code and 
to apply more concepts of object-oriented programming as overall. Hope this simple project can 
be taken as reference by the public.

##How to run?
1. Clone or download this project into your local machine.
2. Compile the project using Java JDK 13 and using any IDE of your choice.
3. Run the program and try to hit the enter key to see the simulation of ants & bugs by triggering
the interaction between them.
